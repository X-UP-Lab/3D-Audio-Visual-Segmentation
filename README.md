**This repository is the official implementation of "3D Audio-Visual Segmentation".** In this paper, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement.

## Updates
- The 3DAVS-S34-O7 dataset and EchoSegnet code are now available !ðŸŽ‰ 
- Data & Code coming soon!
